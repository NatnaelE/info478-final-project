# Project Description
According to Feeding America in 2017, 1 in 8 Americans are food insecure, which equates to 40 million people. Being food insecure is defined as "lacking reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food". The purpose of this project is to analyze food insecurity in the United States and interpret patterns we may find in the data. We hope to make impactful visualizations that will bring light to the public health issue of food insecurity in the US and in specific states.

# The Data
We will be working with a data set from United States Department of Agriculture that looks at food insecurity in the following categories:
- Access and Proximity to Grocery Store
- Store Availability
- Restaurant Availability and Expenditures
- Food Assistance
- State Food Insecurity
- Food Prices and Taxes
- Local Foods
- Health and Physical Activity
- Socioeconomic Characteristics
- There is data on all of these charactristics for every county in each state.

# Target Audience
Our target audiences are policy makers in America, major donors/philathropists, and charities.


# Our Goal
Our goal is for our audience to become familiarized with the severity of food insecurity in certain regions of the United States. We will show how specific factors impact the food insecurity of local populations (data by county), and where American citizens face obstacles in mobility and access of healthy foods and resources.  Our analysis will be exploring the following three questions:

- Is adult obesity rate linked to socioeconomic status?  
- Does food insecurity vary by age?
- In Washington, what counties have the least amount of access to healthy food?

# Technical Description
Our final product will be a compiled RMarkdown page that will be hosted on one of our GitHub profiles.  We like the simplicity and efficiency of creating an RMarkdown resource and can still inject interactivity for specific plots of interest.  

We will begin our analysis by processing the data and ensuring that we can easily view, navigate, and present the data.  We will then begin studying the effects of our three questions of interest, and conclude by developing the final resource that will effectively communicate the results of our analysis.
We anticipate that our primary data management challenges will be sifting through the depth of our dataset.  Since there are 13 categories of data across each county in the United States, our primary challenge will be creating efficient representations of our data once our analysis is complete.  

In terms of new technical skills we will learn, none of us have worked on injecting interactivity into RMarkdown without using Shiny, so we anticipate there will be a slight learning curve as we approach the conclusion of our project.
